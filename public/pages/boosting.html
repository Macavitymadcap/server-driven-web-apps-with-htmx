        <p>
          If you opened this page with the boosted link, the styles should be
          consistent with with the rest of the site, because the boosting means
          that any stylesheets and scripts that are linked to the index page are
          also linked to this page, and any that are loaded in the head of this
          HTML are ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you opened this page with the un-boosted link, the styles and
          scripts that are loaded in the head of this HTML are applied, which is
          why you had to contend with that alert and why your eyes are bleeding
          from the terrible styles.
