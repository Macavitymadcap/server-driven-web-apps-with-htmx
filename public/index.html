        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This website is my working out of the book "Server Driven Web Apps" by
          R. Mark Volkmann. The book shows how to create dynamic web apps using
          a stack of <a href="" target="_blank">Bun</a>,
          <a href="https://hono.dev/" target="_blank">Hono</a>,
          <a href="" target="_blank">htmx</a>, and
          <a href="" target="_blank">JSX</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book is a great introduction to the concepts of server-driven web
          apps, but the stylings are a bit dated. Rather than using the styles
          verbatim, I decided to make this an extra learning oppurtunity and try
          my hand developing my own design system for multi-page web apps. That
          way, with this project completed I'll have a suite of CSS to use in
          future projects.
        </p>

          Each page is roughly a chapter from the book, with my replication of
          the examples and my attempts at the exercises as cards on the page.
          You will notice that a chapter 2 is missing: this is by design as that
          chapter deals with exploring alternate stacks for serving htmx apps.
          While I do not find this stack to be perfect (bun doesn't always run
          the code you write, and JSX still means having to use some React), it
          works for a simple project like this.
        </p>

          Data storgage is ephemeral, so if you refresh the page, the data will
          be lost. The book itslef mainly uses a JSON, but I decided to go a
          step up and take advantage of bun's built in support for
          <a href="https://bun.sh/docs/api/sqlite" target="_blank">SQLite</a>.
          This allowed to work out how to write a simple data access layer,
          although the concerns are smudged together more than they are
          separated, as I have combined the roles of repository and service into
          one class for the sake of simplicity.
